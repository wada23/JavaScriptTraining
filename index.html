        <h1 id="salmon">This is a little article about how I decided to become a web developper:</h1>

        <p>It all started with me meeting Karim. If you want to know who is Karim, I am going to answer your curious question.
            He is my husband. Yes yes. I met him many years ago, when I just came to France as an au-pair. I was very young and beautiful. Haha. 
            And so we met, became friends, then we dated, and then we had our firt baby - Sarah. She was so cute.
            And so we had our second baby - Jasmine. And then our third - Jonas.
            And so I became a mom of three at the age of 27. 
        </p>

        <p>I was so busy trying to care for those three little ducklings and it sure was very hard, but still I was able to learn many skills from crocheting to 
            cooking moroccan dishes to gardening, kind of, to being a wife, yes, that's a skill too, to be a good wife and so on. 
            And so with time I started to ask myself if there are other skills I could or maybe should learn and how they can serve me in the future. 
            I started thinking about my life and how I want it to go on , the life I want to live and the person I want to become. 
        </p>

        <p>
            And so I started to look for jobs I could do from home when my kids will grow up. Once I found an article that named about 40 jobs one could do as a stay at home mum
            and so I started reading. As I read throught I realized that most of those jobs I would not be able to do or I would not like to do. 
            And then there it was. From all the 40 jobs, the most ridiculous yet the most logical for me to do was a web developer. 
        </p>

        <p>As you can assume the ridiculousness was in the fact that I had NOTHING ever in my life to do with any higher computer skills, no special mathematical or logical skills, 
            no education in this domain, and no interest. No interest at first. But when I thought about it (for like 5 minutes) I realized that this is EXACTLY what I have to learn. Or at least try. 

        </p>

        <p>You see, long tima ago, when I was still in a highschool, I had this friend (who dumped me later on) who was doing "something with computers". That's all i knew. That he was interested in these things. 
            Since I didn't know anything, I guess we didn't even had much internet at home at that time, I didn't care. 
            But this friend, I remembered him. And so I knew he became with time a web developper. And so as I remembered this guy while reading this article about jobs, I told myself this: </p>
           
           
        <p>Adela, since nobody expect anything from you, especially anything very "intelligent", why don't you give it a try just to see if you are actually capable of
            something. Since it's such a ridiculous idea to do, 
            nobody, inculding you, won't be dissapointed, beacause this idea of becoming a web developer is such a ridiculous thing. The only thing you can loose is your time spend 
            in a stupid way. And if you can win at least the bare minimum, it will be the fact, that you will talk to your kids about it and it will show them the fact 
            that something like programming even exists and that it could be interesting for them to learn, when they grow up. And that is exactly the one thing you didn't have when you were growing up 
            and that may be why it is your friend from a highschool who is a web developper today and not you. 
        </p>

        <p>And so I gave it a try and started learning the great web developement. 
            In the end I can tell you that the most convincing and incredible actually thing was the fact that I found about the awsome awsome awsome THE ODIN PROJECT. This awsome awsome awsome website made everything so easy that
            I can say, it was probably the main reason why I REALLY got into it. It is quite funny how in life we get exactly what we are asking for. 
            Now I'm asking 'only' for more patience and grit, haha. 
        </p>

        <p>the end</p>
